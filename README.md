## Who am I?

As a mathematical engineer, my technical skills include topics such as mastering ordinary and partial differential equations, spectral or finite difference numerical methods in contexts such as finance or physical systems, game theory, design of experiments, parametric and non-parametric statistical methods, data collection, cleaning and processing, exploratory data analysis, creation of machine learning models for different tasks, mathematical modeling techniques, creation of heuristic algorithms for network organization and distribution problems. For this I use tools such as MATLAB, R, Python, SQL, Simulink, Bash script and Lua. 

As a person, I stand out for my curiosity, serenity and kindness, which facilitates the construction of meaningful relationships. My assertive communication allows me to express ideas clearly in work teams. My proactive approach and ability to identify patterns help me to think innovatively. Valuing organization and time, I meet deadlines and manage tasks efficiently. I can be adaptable and I am always committed to learning and personal growth through knowledge, understanding the importance of knowledge for the self.

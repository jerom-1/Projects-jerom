# Job Shop Scheduling Problem

In this study, we aim to approximate the optimal solutions for various instances of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). Initially, we employ a constructive algorithm to generate an initial solution vector. Subsequently, we utilize local search techniques, including the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), along with different neighborhoods to iteratively refine the solution. This comprehensive approach enables us to efficiently explore the solution space and ultimately converge towards high-quality solutions for each instance of the JSSP.

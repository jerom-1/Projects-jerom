# Solution of nonlinear differential equations with time delay by using Legendre wavelet method optimized with NSGA-II

Legendre wavelets are proposed to solve differential equations with delays due to their mathematical properties that allow to decompose the problem in different time scales. Their mathematical properties that allow decomposing the problem in different time scales, which facilitates the analysis of the effects of the recent past in the evolution of the system.
This facilitates the analysis of the effects of the recent past on the evolution of the system. By applying this multi-scale decomposition
decomposition technique, an efficient numerical approximation and solution of the differential equations with delays is achieved.
differential equations with delays. In addition to Legendre's wavelets, this work proposes that the implementation of genetic algorithms can be an alternative strategy to the use of iterative methods to approximate the coefficients of the functions in context.
functions in context. This hybrid approach allows to explore and adjust the parameters of the approximate functions, thus improving the approximate functions, thus improving the prediction and understanding capacity of the dynamic systems.

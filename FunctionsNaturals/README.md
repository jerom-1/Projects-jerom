# Functions with natural numbers in Haskell


This Haskell project implements various mathematical functions on natural numbers (Nat). It includes operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, factorial, as well as auxiliary functions like generating random natural numbers for testing purposes. The implementation showcases different recursive patterns and data structures, providing insights into Haskell's functional programming paradigm.

# Iterative analysis in information games. Formalization and algorithmic solution of wordle.

This code revolves around the strong and particular mathematical bonds that Wordle shares
with the theory of probabilities, specifically with information theory. It is under the most
rigorous mathematical care that we can develop an abstraction over the game and the actions
that are allowed in it as if it was a system built in with basic set operations and with
various original definitions. As an overview we can note that the intentions of the authors
are focused in providing a tenacious justification in the applicability of information theory
that the mathematical divulgator Grant Sanderson discovered inside this game, at the same
time that is looked forward the possibility to overcome his results with the algorithmic solution.
As Grant pretends, the ultimate purpose relies in finding a list of words that serve as
an opening strategy for the human player.

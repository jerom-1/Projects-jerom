# On the analytical and numerical solution for the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation

The Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) presents a significant challenge due to the limited number of known solutions and the underlying theoretical
complexity of the equations. For that we propose a comprehensive numerical study of the equation
to identify the most effective high-performance numerical techniques for simulating the NLS model.
In this context, we consider two primary approaches: finite difference methods and pseudospectral
methods

# Generation of new data with the same probability distribution and statistics

The objective of this project is to generate new data that have the same distribution of probability and statistics of the original dataset. It is possible because we can generate a frequency table with an input number of classes, and storage the data from that table, and because of the statistics taked from the table we can generate the mentioned new data. 

It have a lot of applications when we lose the data and we only have the frecuency table or we want to create a frecuency table from a dataset.
